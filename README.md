### Project Description:
First we were to create a New Remote Repository in GitHub. Then we created a Cloud9 Workspace.
The next part of the assignment was to enhance the Photo Gallery with the arrows (left and right), that allowed the user to select through the images. The last item of the assignment was to make the "Show more images" button to become active and then add two additional pictures to the gallery so you can see five instead of three images. "

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned a lot in the KHANAcademy portion of the Exercise. I found it easy to follow and very informative.
2. Another concept I learned was the access of elements using the id, tag name, class, name or selector. I think it was really coolhow you can do a "find and replace" using the elements that way.
3. A third lesson I learned was the whole idea of the DOM. Seeing how it diagrams a website was very interesting.
